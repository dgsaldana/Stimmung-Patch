A vocoder (Waves Morphoder) on the same pitches has been embedded into the sinusoidal synthesis, processing the six singers. Six microphone input signals and three outputs are required. Main LR out + Mono vocal signal return for singer floor monitor. The electronics performer sits outside of the central circle. There is an additional PTZ camera control option through HTTP command sent from the patch if projection is available in the venue.
